## Configuration

1. Ensure to have in the working directory de CSV files "inital\_probabilities" that contain the inital probabilities for each subject.

2. Ensure to have in the working directory the CSV files "Kstable" for each subject. 

3. Change the file paths in Simulation.java where the results will be saved to plot them in MATLAB.

## Notes

To run a step for a new subject, there are needed the files of its initial probabilities and KsTable.
