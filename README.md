# BayesianFES
This repository contains the entire source code that has been used for the implementation of the Bayesian algorithm for prediction of sFESS patterns. It contains two main parts:
  1. Java code (`java_code/`):
     - `realTimeExecution/`: README inside explains how to run the real-time IMU & TEREFES controller.
     - simulation/`:  README inside explains how to run the Bayesian simulation.
     - `auxiliar/` contains additional methods.
     - There are included all the `.CSV` and `.txt`files that have been generated during the execution fo this two modules
  3. MATLAB scripts (`matlab_scripts/`):
  Each `.m` file has its own `_README.md` next to it explaining inputs, usage, and outputs. There are also all the files needed for the execution of this scripts.
  

## Getting started
  1. Clone this respository.
  2. Download the necessary files
  3. Follow the README.md in each folder (`java_code/.../README.md` or `matlab_scripts/..._README.md`).
