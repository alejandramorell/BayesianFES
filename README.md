# BayesianFES
This repository contains the entire source code that has been used for the implementation of the Bayesian algorithm for prediction of sFESS patterns. It contains two main parts:
  1. Java code (`java_code/`):
     - `realTimeExecution/` — README inside explains how to run the real-time IMU & TEREFES       controller.
     - simulation/` — README inside explains how to run the Bayesian simulation.
    
  3. MATLAB scripts (`matlab_scripts/`):
  Each `.m` file has its own `_README.md` next to it explaining inputs, usage, and outputs.
  

## Getting started
  1. Clone this respository.
  2. Follow the README.md in each folder (`java_code/.../README.md` or `matlab_scripts/..._README.md`).
